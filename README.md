If need to mention shortly from my history, I was born and grew up in Düzce. When I was in middle school, I broke my arm accidentally. That was a bad memory that I remembered. Then I Passed to high school, my high school's name is Farabi Anadolu Lisesi in Düzce. I started school with excitement but in the end, the pandemic came all over the world. That was a second bad
memory for me because I couldn't do anything about my lessons while I was in those days. So I broke away from lessons and started to play games. It continued up until I met the coding. After that day everything started to be
more exciting and I learned everything I could learn in that period. Then I was the 12th high school student and had to study for YKS so I had a break from coding and started studying for an exam that I'll take at the end of the year.
And won the Software Engineering Department of Karabük University. Yeah, I'm here and trying to improve myself as much as I can. That is all about me thanks for reading.
